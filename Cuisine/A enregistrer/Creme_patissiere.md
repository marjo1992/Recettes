Dans une casserole

In a saucepan over medium heat, heat the milk and vanilla bean paste, stirring occasionally until the milk is hot but not boiling!
Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine the superfine sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Whisk in yolks all at once until light and fluffy and batter reaches the ribbon stage.
As you continue whisking, slowly add one-third of the hot milk to the yolk mixture to temper the egg yolks. 
Whisk remaining milk into yolks and return entire mixture to saucepan.
Place over medium heat and whisk frequently until the mixture begins to boil.
Whisk the mixture vigorously for 2 minutes, while boiling until the cornstarch dissolves completely.
Remove the pan from the heat, whisk in the butter in small increments.
Strain the vanilla cream mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a bwol.
With a silicone spatula, spread the vanilla cream into a thin layer on a small baking sheet.
Lay a sheet of plastic wrap directly over the vanilla cream. Allow it to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for a few hours.
When ready to use, loosen the cream with a spatula or whisk.
Pastry cream should be refrigerated and used within 3 days of making.
